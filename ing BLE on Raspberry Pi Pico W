[31m-# Getting Started with Create React App[m
[32m+[m[32m# Crowd Tracking using BLE on Raspberry Pi Pico W[m
 [m
[31m-This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).[m
[32m+[m[32mThis project focuses on the development of a crowd tracking system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller. The primary objective is to create a reliable solution for accurately monitoring and tracking the movement of individuals within a designated area.[m
 [m
[31m-## Available Scripts[m
[32m+[m[32m# Project Overview[m
 [m
[31m-In the project directory, you can run:[m
[32m+[m[32mThe implementation involves the integration of BLE technology to facilitate seamless communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico W and various BLE-enabled wearable devices. By leveraging the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, I aim to achieve precise localization and data collection, enabling effective crowd management and optimization of spatial resources.[m

[32m+[m[32m# Panda - BLE Device[m
 [m
[31m-### `npm test`[m
[32m+[m[32mThe 'Panda' directory contains the MicroPython code specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It includes the necessary scripts and configurations to enable BLE communication and accurate tracking of individuals within the designated area.

 [m
[31m-Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\[m
[31m-See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.[m

 [m
[31m-### `npm run build`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\[m
[31m-It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\[m
[31m-Your app is ready to be deployed![m

[31m-See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### `npm run eject`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.[m
